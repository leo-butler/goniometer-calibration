\section{Preamble}
\label{sec:pre}
The purpose of this file is to communicate ideas/comments on the
paper. Feel free to delete comments/questions that you have raised if
you feel they have been resolved. At the end, this section should be
the only non-empty section.

Notation: vXXlYYcZZ will refer to version XX, line YY and optionally
column (or character) ZZ on line YY.

Document structure: it should be structured like
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{qc}        <-- begin the list of questions/comments
  \begin{qcitem}  <-- begin a question/comment
    \LB           <-- comments by Leo
    \RG           <-- comments by Roman
  \end{qcitem}    <-- end a question/comment
  .
  .               <-- more qcitem environments
  .
  \begin{qcitem}[done]  <-- a finished question/comment (appears in gray)
    .
    .
  \end{qcitem}          <-- end of same question/comment
\end{qc}          <-- end list of questions/comments
\end{verbatim}
so there is need for only one \verb#qc# environment, and distinct
questions/comments can be put into distinct \verb#qcitem#
environments. There is no need to use {\it italics} to show who said
what or to use \verb#\\# to end a line, just start your comment on a
new line and preface your comment with \verb#\RG#.
