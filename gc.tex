\title[Goniometer]{Calibration of a Goniometer with Constrained Least
  Squares}

  This note shows how a goniometer may be calibrated using the method
  of constrained least squares. We obtain error-bounds also.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This note applies the geometric technique of constrained least
squares, or more generally, constrained optimization to the problem of
calibrating a physical instrument.

\subsection{The Goniometer and its Calibration}
\label{sec:goniometer-intro}

\subsection{The Geometric Model}
\label{sec:geometric-model}

From the description of the calibration problem, we have a number of
planes $P_i$ which intersect pairwise in the same line $\ell$. Our
measurements are of points $y_{ij}=x_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij}$, where
$x_{ij}$ lies on the plane $P_i$ and $\epsilon_{ij}$ is an error in
the measurement. We want to develop an estimator $\estimate{\ell}$ of
$\ell$ from the measurements $y_{ij}$.

To explain how to do this, a few observations are in order. First,
each {\em oriented} line $\ell$ in $\R^3$ is uniquely determined by
the point $p \in \ell$ that is closest to $0$ and its unit direction
vector $v$; an {\em unoriented} line is uniquely determined by $p$ and
$\set{\pm v}$. That is,
\begin{align*}
  L_+ &= \set{ (p,v) \in \R^3 \times \R^3 \st \ip{p}{v}=0,\norm{v}=1 }
    && =\textrm{set of oriented lines in }\R^3,\\
    L &= L_+/\sim, && =\textrm{set of unoriented lines in }\R^3,
\end{align*}
where $(p,v) \sim (p,-v)$. The set $L_+$ of oriented lines is the
tangent bundle of the unit sphere in $\R^3$; the set $L$ of unoriented
lines does not have such a nice description.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\footnote{It is not the tangent bundle of real projective plane;
  rather, it is the pull-back bundle of the tangent bundle of $S^2$
  under the projection map from $S^2$ to the real projective plane.}
\ %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
One can measure distance between `points' (i.e. oriented lines) $\ell_+=(p,v)$
and $\ell'_+=(p',v')$ in $L_+$ by the euclidean distance on $\R^3
\times \R^2$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:distance-between-lines}
  \dist{\ell_+}{\ell'_+}^2 = \norm{p-p'}^2 + \norm{v-v'}^2
\end{equation}
and the corresponding distance between two unoriented lines is defined
by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:distance-between-unoriented-lines}
  \dist{\ell}{\ell'}^2 = \norm{p-p'}^2 + \min\set{ \norm{v-v'}^2,\norm{v+v'}^2}
\end{equation}

Let $Q_i=\set{y_{ij}=x_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij} \st j=1,\ldots,n_i}$ be a
set of non-collinear points, where $x_{ij} \in P_i$ and
$\epsilon_{ij}$ is a measurement error. Each set of $3$ points in
$Q_i$ defines a plane that is approximately $P_i$. Let
$\powerset{Q_i}{3}$ be set of planes defined by each $3$-subset of
  $Q_i$. If one supposes that there is a unique line $\ell$ such that
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:plane-intersection}
    P_i \cap P_j &= \ell && \forall i\neq j,
  \end{align}
then the function
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:objective-function}
  \omega(\ell) := \sum_{i < j}
  \sum_{P\in\powerset{Q_i}{3},P'\in\powerset{Q_j}{3}} \dist{P \cap P'}{\ell}^2
\end{align}
is a natural choice of objective function. Our estimator of the line
$\ell$ is defined by
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:line-estimator}
  \estimate{\ell} := \argmin{\ell}{\omega}.
\end{align}
